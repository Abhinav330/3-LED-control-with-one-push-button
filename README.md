# 3-LED-control-with-one-push-button
code for controlling 3 LED's from a push button
things needed :
1 arduino uno
2 led's any colour
3 resistance of 100 ohms
4. 1 push button
and some wires 

steps by step guide :
1. connect one resistor to negative end of each led.
2. connect another leg of resistors with arduino gnd (ground) pin.
3. connect led positive pins to digital pin 2, 3, 4 of arduino.
4. connect push button one led of a side with gnd of arduino and other side of one pin with arduino pin 5
5. upload the code and enjoy.
